# Equivalent water thickness/canopy water content from hyperspectral data

This tutorial shows how to calculate equivalent water thickness or canopy water content (CWC) from [AVIRIS-NG](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p=47) data. Variation in CWC can indicate drought stress and wildfire risk.

We will apply a simple fitting of spectral absorption features of liquid water and use scripts available from [ISOFIT package](https://github.com/isofit/isofit/tree/main).

## Canopy Water Content (CWC)
First, surface reflectance was derived using the Optimal Estimation-based simultaneous modeling of surface and atmosphere through the ISOFIT codebase. Derived surface reflectance spectra were particularly smooth in water absorption bands and include estimates of per-band posterior uncertainties (Thompson et al. 2018).

The CWS was then derived from surface reflectance by applying a well-validated algorithm based on a physical model (Beer-Lambert model) (Green et al. 2006; Bohn et al. 2020). Of note, this model does not account for multiple scattering effects within the canopy and may result in overestimation of retrieved CWC (Bohn et al. 2020).
