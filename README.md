# Equivalent water thickness/canopy water content from hyperspectral data

This tutorial shows how to calculate equivalent water thickness/canopy water content from [AVIRIS-NG](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p=47) data.

We will use scripts available from [ISOFIT package](https://github.com/isofit/isofit/tree/main).
